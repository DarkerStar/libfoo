**NOTE:** Before reporting a security concern using a public issue,
consider instead whether it might be wiser to report the issue
privately. That will give us a chance to resolve the issue, and release
a fixed version without the vulnerability, so that users can upgrade to
a secure version before knowledge of the issue becomes public. See the
projectâ€™s security policy for more information.

## Description

Please describe the security concern.

*   What is the cause of the suspected vulnerability?
*   Is the cause of the vulnerability a bug in the code, or a design flaw?
*   How might it be exploited?
*   What damage or further exploitation could it cause?


## Other information

Please provide any other relevant information or context that might help.
